# FInal Deliverable
As I didn't really create any software, most of the documentation for my process in reverse engineering is held in the pdfs within the final deliverable folder. Theyre aptly named Solution, and Solution_Ionchad.
The crackmes that I created are in a seperate file without their solutions as I already have the source code, it didn't make sense to document my process for reversing what I created.

This repository contains all of the crackmes that I made myself, and two crackmes I retrieved online from the website crackmes.one. crackmes.one is a library of crackme problems uploaded by users. 

#Project Goal
This project's goal was for me to learn the art of reverse engineering software, but It was a lot harder than I thought at the beginning. The crackmes stayed within the 2.0 difficulty range as with the time given I was unable to complete any that were more difficult than that. Im sure that given enough time, or a smarter individual was given this project, more could been for this project

#Future work
In the future more, and harder crackmes could be done, a long with the easier crackmes being reconstructed. However, I will not be continiung this project, this is going to give me nightmares.
