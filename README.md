# FInal Deliverable
As I didn't really create any software, most of the documentation for my process in reverse engineering is held in the pdfs within the final deliverable folder. Theyre aptly named Solution, and Solution_Ionchad.
The crackmes that I created are in a seperate file without their solutions as I already have the source code, it didn't make sense to document my process for reversing what I created.
